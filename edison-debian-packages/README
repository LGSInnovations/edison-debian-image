If your Edison doesn't have internet it can't get some packages.  As
the point of the Edison-Ethernet project is to give internet to those
without wireless, that may be difficult.  It is also difficult to get
packages on the device without networking.  You can place these packages
in:

/var/cache/apt/archives

and install with the command:

apt-get install -y sudo macchanger

this is something that could be done in the /sbin/first-install.sh script

apt-get clean

is a useful command to clean up those packages once they are installed and
save some space.
