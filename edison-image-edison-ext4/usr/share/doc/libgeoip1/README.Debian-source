In the dfsg version, the following file has been changed, because
it has a non dfsg-free copyright statement:

  - data/GeoIP.dat

I removed with the following sed line the non-free copyright statement:
	$ sed 's/ All Rights Reserved//' -i data/GeoIP.dat


I asked in an email the upstream author for permissions to change this
non-free copyright statement, here is the full email conversation with
all headers:

Hello Maxmind,

I'm the new Debian package maintainer of GeoIP and I've got a copyright
problem with it.

As discussed in [1] geoip is normaly completly unsuiteable for the
Debian pool (main and non-free), because of the following copyright
header:
* Copyright (C) 2003 MaxMind LLC  All Rights Reserved.
I've found it in:
geoip-1.3.17/data/GeoIP.dat
geoip-1.3.17/libGeoIP/GeoIP.c
geoip-1.3.17/libGeoIP/GeoIPCity.h

This is an older version. In 1.4.3 it has been removed from libGeoIP/ -
which is very good, but it's still at the end of the file
data/GeoIP.dat. The problem is, that we're so not allowed to modify this
file and ship this with a package. Could you please remove this one from
the file, too?
If not, I think I've no other choice as to remove this library from the
Debian pool.

I hope we will found a good solution for it.
