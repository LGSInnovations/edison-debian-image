* Debian policy 3.9.2, MULTIARCH
  - update docs, it probably requires special flags for configure if
    one does not want to do all the multiarchifying of paths manually

Old stuff, might not apply anymore:

o Verify if policy 3.6, section 7.6 is not broken for arch all re. clean target

o Implement transition plan for DEB_*_GNU_TYPE written with
  Marcus Brinkmann <Marcus.Brinkmann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>. 
  Check ML archives for thread.

  This is post-woody.
