libusbx
=======

libusbx is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows and OpenBSD userspace (with OpenBSD, and to a lesser extent
Windows, currently being considered EXPERIMENTAL).
It is written in C and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1 or (at your option) any later version (see COPYING).

libusbx is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.
