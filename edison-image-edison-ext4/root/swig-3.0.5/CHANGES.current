Version 3.0.5 (31 Jan 2015)
===========================

2015-01-30: wsfulton
            [Python] Fix Python -classic and property setting. Setting properties on classic classes
            was broken in swig-3.0.3 by attempting to use __setattr__. This regression is fixed now
            by using __dict__ again when using -classic.
            Fixes patch #232.

2015-01-27: smarchetto
	    [Scilab] Support for the Scilab language has been added

2015-01-23: olly
	    [PHP] When wrapping a returned resource as an object, check if all
	    cases wrap it in the same class, and if so eliminate the pointless
	    switch statement wrapper we previously generated.

2015-01-22: wsfulton
            [Octave] Merge patch #297 for SF bug #1277 - Octave shared_ptr support

2015-01-15: wsfulton
            [Python] Merge patch #250 - Fixes for using %constant and objects (non-primitive types)

2015-01-15: wsfulton
            [C# Go] Merge patch #308 and fix #307 - C++11 strongly typed enum support
            in directors

2015-01-15: wsfulton
            [Python] Second fix for #294 #296 - Regression introduced in SWIG-3.0.3 when
            wrapping functions with default arguments, this time when using kwargs.
