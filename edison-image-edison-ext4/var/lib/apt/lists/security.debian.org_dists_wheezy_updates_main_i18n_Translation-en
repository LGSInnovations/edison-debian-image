Description-en: GNU a2ps - 'Anything to PostScript' converter and pretty-printer
 GNU a2ps converts files into PostScript for printing or viewing. It uses a
 nice default format, usually two pages on each physical page, borders
 surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing
 date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, symbol substitution
 as well as pretty printing for a wide range of programming languages.
 .
 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,
  - and various spoken languages.

Package: apache2-mpm-event
Description-md5: a80d3fe69689b28f8aea325690e6e8f5
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - event driven model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The event MPM is designed to allow more requests to be served
 simultaneously by passing off some processing work to supporting
 threads, freeing up the main threads to work on new requests. It is
 especially suitable for sites that see extensive KeepAlive traffic.
 .
 This MPM is experimental and less tested than the worker and prefork MPMs.

Package: apache2-mpm-itk
Description-md5: 852c600a072cd8e2a37f461a6a0916ad
Description-en: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2
 The ITK Multi-Processing Module (MPM) works in about the same way as the
 classical "prefork" module (that is, without threads), except that it allows
 you to constrain each individual vhost to a particular system user. This
 allows you to run several different web sites on a single server without
 worrying that they will be able to read each others' files. This is a
 third-party MPM that is not included in the normal Apache httpd.
 .
 Please note that this MPM is somewhat less tested than the MPMs that come with
 Apache itself.

Package: apache2-mpm-prefork
Description-md5: b1e3963f43f27f985efabc714e30a17e
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable
 number of processes where each process handles only one connection
 at the same time. It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to
 be more stable. It is appropriate for sites that need to maintain
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for
 isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will not
 affect any other.

Package: apache2-mpm-worker
Description-md5: 5c9df5383d0a2631ae15ced2ca0389d7
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The worker MPM provides the default threaded implementation. It is
 recommended especially for high-traffic sites because it is faster
 and has a smaller memory footprint than the traditional prefork MPM.

 It consists of a pair of programs :
 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.  It
 obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems, and adjusts the system time accordingly.  For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by hand
 (using `chronyc').  In either case, `chronyd' determines the rate at which
 the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.  Chronyd
 implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or a server.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within the
 daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

Description-md5: f8eed21b7f3e0ce6b263a0f4db368796
Description-en: mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system
 Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
 HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote
 web server. davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like
 a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no
 built-in support for WebDAV.
 .
 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of
 Unix-like systems (mount, umount, et c.). davfs2 makes
 mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.
 .
 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive,
 to avoid unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope
 for slow or unreliable connections.
 .
 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.

 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages

 (security-wise) debugging features.
 .
 ECMAScript (ECMA-262) is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype
 based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to
 both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn
 the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while
 loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as these
 languages (or nearly so).
 .
 JavaScript is a superset of the ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ECMAScript) standard
 first introduced by Netscape and now led by the Mozilla project.

 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"

Description-en: Java Framework for MVC web applications
 The core of the Struts framework is a flexible control layer based on standard
 technologies like Servlets, JavaBeans, ResourceBundles, and Extensible
 Markup Language (XML), as well as various Apache Commons packages. Struts
 encourages application architectures based on the Model 2 approach, a
 variation of the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.
 .
 Struts provides its own Controller component and integrates with other
 technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, Struts can
 interact with any standard data access technology, including Enterprise Java
 Beans (EJB), JDBC, and Object Relational Bridge. For the View, Struts works
 well with JavaServer Pages (JSP), including JSTL and JSF, as well as Velocity
 Templates, XSLT, and other presentation systems.

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.

 Lsyncd (Live syncing mirror daemon) uses rsync to synchronize local
 directories with a remote machine running rsyncd. Lsyncd watches
 multiple directories trees through inotify. The first step after
 adding the watches is to rsync all directories with the remote host,
 and then sync single file by collecting the inotify events. So lsyncd
 is a light-weight live mirror solution that should be easy to install
 and use while blending
 well with your system.

Package: memcached
Description-md5: c96e946324d6d6114d0daad2388780d3
Description-en: A high-performance memory object caching system
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description-en: command-line tools for SSH, SCP, and SFTP
 This package provides four command-line tools from the PuTTY suite that
 allow various kinds of secure interaction with remote systems.
 .
 Plink (PuTTY Link) connects to a remote system via SSH, Telnet, or rlogin,
 and either starts an interactive session or runs a batch process. It
 supports the usual SSH features like port forwarding, X11 forwarding,
 SOCKS, and compression.
 .
 PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy) transfers files securely between systems using an
 SSH connection. It works with both SSH protocol 1 and protocol 2.
 .
 PSFTP (PuTTY SFTP client) transfers files securely between systems using
 the SSH file transfer protocol, which is specific to SSH protocol 2. In
 interactive mode its interface is much like the traditional Unix FTP
 client, although it can also operate in batch mode.
 .
 PuTTYgen generates SSH public and private key pairs in any of a number of
 formats, including those usable by PuTTY, OpenSSH, and ssh.com.
 .
 All these utilities can make use of PuTTY's saved sessions where
 appropriate.

 SPIP is a publishing system for the Internet in which great importance
 is attached to collaborative working, to multilingual environments,
 and to simplicity of use for web authors.
 .
 SPIP's benefit consists in:
 .
  * managing a magazine type site i.e. made up mainly of
    articles and news items inserted in an arborescence
    of sections nested in each others.
  * completely separating and distributing three kinds of tasks
    over various players: the graphic design, the site editorial
    input through the submission of articles and news items and
    the site editorial management.
  * spare the webmaster and all the participants to the life of
    the site, a number of tedious aspects of web publishing as
    well as the need to learn lengthy technical skills.
    SPIP allows you to start creating your sections and
    articles straight away.

Description-en: OpenStack Object Storage - libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
