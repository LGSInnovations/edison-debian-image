Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

 AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for writing
 input files for TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt/Texinfo using GNU Emacs.  Currently
 XEmacs ships with its own AUCTeX version.
 .
 It supports processing source files by running TeX and related tools
 (such as output filters, post processors for generating indices and
 bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX allows browsing
 through the errors reported by TeX, while it moves the cursor directly to
 the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
 error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
 files.
 .
 AUCTeX can automatically indent LaTeX source, either line by line or for
 an entire document, and has a special outline feature which can greatly
 assist in getting an overview of a document.
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, and may therefore be enhanced
 with new features for specific needs.  It comes with a large range of
 handy Emacs macros.  It is a GNU project, and documentation for all its
 features is accessible via the Emacs info browser.

 .
 The installation of this metapackage will install other BILIBOP packages

 and runs from an external device.

 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.

 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 This package provides shell functions usable by other bilibop scripts on the
 running system or into the initramfs environment. These functions use /dev,
 /proc and /sys databases to output the drive name or the partition hosting
 the running system, and are fully usable by any unprivileged user or
 application. Dm-crypt, LVM, loop devices and aufs root filesystems (and any
 combination of them) are supported. A 'drivemap' command is also provided,
 to show block devices in a tree of dependencies.
 .

Package: bilibop-lockfs
Description-md5: f79b3e4ad5a65a628ffba16f78243f02
Description-en: lock filesystems and write changes into RAM
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 If the lockfs feature is enabled (in a configuration file, in the boot
 commandline or by a heuristic), nothing will be written on the filesystems
 listed in /etc/fstab, except for those that have been whitelisted, or for
 the encrypted swap devices. More, bilibop-lockfs now is able to detect if
 the drive has been locked by a physical switch, and then overrides its own
 settings to unconditionally apply a 'hard' policy.
 .
 The root filesystem is locked (set readonly, using aufs) by an initramfs
 script which also modifies the temporary fstab to prepare other filesystems
 to be locked later by a mount helper script.
 .
 bilibop-lockfs provides the following features:
  * whitelist based policy: filesystems on which you want to allow persistent
    changes must be explicitly listed in a configuration file.
  * swap devices policy: they can be used 'as is', noauto, only if encrypted,
    only if encrypted with a random key, or not used at all.
  * not only filesystems are set read-only, but also block devices: this
    forbids changes of the partition table, boot sectors, LUKS headers and
    LVM metadata.
  * plymouth messages to know at boot time if bilibop-lockfs is enabled or
    not, or if an error occured.
  * desktop notifications at startup about filesystems status, to inform the
    user that volatile or persistent changes are allowed or not, and where.
 .
 This package can be used as an alternative to fsprotect or overlayroot,
 especially for writable operating systems embedded on a USB stick; but it
 may also be installed on public or personal computers, for daily use,
 kiosks, testing purposes, or as a tool in anti-forensics strategies.
 .
 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.

Description-en: device management rules for OS running from external media
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 This package provides a udev rules file to manage the external drive hosting
 the running system. Its main goal is to forbid low-level write access on this
 drive and its partitions by any unprivileged user or application, but some
 other convenient and optional rules have been added for desktop-level
 management of the system disk and partitions (need udisks), as well as the
 internal disks of the computer. The 'lsbilibop' command allows the admin to
 update udev properties of the devices after the configuration file has been
 modified.
 .
 To ease device management, bilibop-rules also provides helper scripts to:
  * build custom bilibop udev rules running faster than the generic ones
  * make some persistent and cumulative udev rules files unpersistent
  * use either a fake or an always-up-to-date grub device map
  * filter Physical Volumes, to activate only those needed by the system
 .
 This package is not designed to be used on internal disks. It works only
 for OS installed on removable and writable media, including LiveUSB systems.

Description-md5: 677f2a00e31e316c282b8bf13f2fbe19
Description-en: build log hardening check
 Perl tool which checks build logs for missing hardening
 flags. Hardening flags enable additional security features in the
 compiler to prevent e.g. stack overflows, format string
 vulnerabilities, GOT overwrites, etc. See e.g.
 <http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags>.
 .
 Because most build systems are quite complicated there are many
 places where compiler flags from the environment might be ignored.
 The parser verifies that all compiler commands use the correct
 hardening flags and thus all hardening features are correctly used.
 .
 It's designed to check build logs generated by Debian's
 dpkg-buildpackage (or tools using dpkg-buildpackage like pbuilder or
 the official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing
 hardening flags in their packages.

 Sphinx extensions.  Cloud and its extensions are primarily oriented
 towards generating html documentation for Python libraries. It provides
 numerous small enhancements to make the html documentation more
 interactive, and improve the layout on mobile devices.
 .
 In addition to the Cloud theme, this package provides a few extra Sphinx
 extensions which may be useful when documenting Python projects; and
 should be theme-agnostic:
 .
 cloud_sptheme.ext.autodoc_sections
   Patches the sphinx.ext.autodoc to handle RST section headers inside
   docstrings.
 cloud_sptheme.ext.issue_tracker
   Adds a special :issue: role for quickly linking to your project's
   issue tracker.
 cloud_sptheme.ext.escaped_samp_literals
   Patches Sphinx to permit escaped {} characters within a :samp: role.
 cloud_sptheme.ext.table_styling
   Enhances .. table directive to support per-column text alignment and
   other layout features.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of cloud_sptheme.

 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
 has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an

 The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
 compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
 interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
 seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
 pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
 work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
 faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

 postinst code to perform the diversions using the standard debhelper
 mechanism.  In addition to a debhelper command and sequencer extension
 module, CDBS modules are also included, but future development will

Package: corekeeper
Description-md5: 287acd254e78c838d144e6715f2ca91f
Description-en: enable core files and report crashes to the sysadmin
 corekeeper enables core files, reports crashes to the sysadmin and
 deletes old core files after 7 days.
 .
 Core file dumping is enabled for all users, to restrict that, please
 remove or edit the config file at /etc/security/limits.d/corekeeper.conf
 .
 On Linux core files are written to private per-userid dirs in /var/crash.
 Linux 3.6 and earlier have an issue that means all core files are written
 to the directory for root. If your system is running Linux 3.6 or earlier
 and is single-user (or you don't care about the privacy of core file names),
 you can avoid this issue by editing /etc/sysctl.d/corekeeper.conf.
 .
 On kFreeBSD files are written to /var/crash, kernel limitations prevent
 core files from being written to private per-userid dirs.
 .
 To fully remove this package it needs to be purged and the system rebooted.

 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: darktable
Description-md5: e032162292249abbe68076444d6959cc
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using libraw, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

Package: diskscan
Description-md5: a7612c6515780c86d4fd97aa2f761ebd
Description-en: scan storage media for bad or near failure sectors
 diskscan is intended to find sectors of a storage medium
 (hard disk, flash drive or pendrive, etc.) which are bad
 or in the process of going bad.
 .
 The operation is entirely read-only and does not cause
 damage to the data on filesystems. As the program reads
 block device sectors, it will work whether there is a
 filesystem or not.
 .
 diskscan reads the entire block device and notes the time
 it took to read a block. When there is an error it is
 immediately noted and also when there is a higher latency
 to read a block. A histogram of the block latency times is
 also given to assess the health of the medium.
 .
 diskscan can also be used to test the speed and quality of
 the medium. All sectors of a perfect medium could be read
 at the same speed.

Package: freedv
Description-md5: 57c3ed2e5648b9a106b57aa338f2fa0d
Description-en: Software Defined Radio (SDR)
 FreeDV is a digital voice mode intended for transmission and
 reception over high-frequency (HF) radio. It uses a frequency
 division multiplex (FDM) modem with 15 carriers and no forward error
 correction (FEC). A low bit-rate voice coder-decoder (Codec 2)
 provides voice quality without the listener fatigue caused by noise
 and interference normally associated with analog single sideband
 (SSB) voice. A HF SSB transceiver, personal computer and two sound
 cards are required. Path simulation and on-the-air HF testing have
 shown that decoding voice is possible at a signal-to-noise ratio of
 4 dB.
 .
 The FreeDV software was developed by David Rowe (Codec 2, FDM
 modem implementation, integration) and David Witten (GUI,
 architecture design). The FreeDV design and user interface was based
 on the earlier FDMDV program which was developed by Francesco
 Lanza. The FDM modem design and development was supported from Peter
 Martinez.

 In addition, fdpowermon can optionally call perl subroutines when the
 power reaches a given level. No such subroutines are provided or
 enabled by default, however.

 that icon theme is fairly large (several tens of megabytes), which is a
 waste if the oxygen-icon-theme package is not installed for other
 reasons. Therefore, this package contains just those icons from the
 oxygen-icon-theme package that are needed by fdpowermon, and nothing
 more.

Package: git-annex
Description-md5: ed39e4e4c2d1afd0f4612868aabeeec0
Description-en: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
 git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
 contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
 dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
 to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
 .
 It can store large files in many places, from local hard drives, to a
 large number of cloud storage services, including S3, WebDAV,
 and rsync, with a dozen cloud storage providers usable via plugins.
 Files can be stored encrypted with gpg, so that the cloud storage
 provider cannot see your data. git-annex keeps track of where each file
 is stored, so it knows how many copies are available, and has many
 facilities to ensure your data is preserved.
 .
 git-annex can also be used to keep a folder in sync between computers,
 noticing when files are changed, and automatically committing them
 to git and transferring them to other computers. The git-annex webapp
 makes it easy to set up and use git-annex this way.

Package: gitolite3
Description-md5: 458db366714b53b29b08a7091183f01b
Description-en: SSH-based gatekeeper for git repositories (version 3)
 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that
 hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite,
 each developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would need a
 user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just using
 SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts all the
 repositories.
 .
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
 (push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an
 important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:
   * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
   * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
   * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
   * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
   * easy integration with gitweb;
   * comprehensive logging;
   * easy migration from gitosis.

Description-en: GNU Radio Software Radio Toolkit
 GNU Radio provides signal processing blocks to implement software
 radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF
 hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a
 simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic
 and commercial environments to support both wireless communications
 research and real-world radio systems.
 .
 GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python
 programming language, while the supplied performance-critical signal
 processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point
 extensions, where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement
 real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use,
 rapid-application-development environment.
 .
 While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support
 development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or
 generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.

Description-en: GNU Radio Blind IQ imbalance estimator and correction
 The general idea is to suppress symmetrical images caused by IQ
 imbalance in the RX path of quadrature receivers.
 It's composed of two subblocks:
 .
 "IQ Bal Fix": This applies the actual correction. to a complex
 stream. The correction parameters are only magnitude/phase and the
 actual correction algo is the same as applied in hardware in the USRP.
 You can either specify the correction parameters manually on the
 block, or send them via 'messages'.
 .
 "IQ Bal Optimize": This blocks tries to blindly detect the imbalance
 by minimizing the correlation between the left and right part of the
 spectrum. See the code for the "how it does it". The general idea is
 inspired from papers found on the internet and the way some SDR
 software achieve the same things (sdr# for eg, although there are
 significant differences in the actual implementation).

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 9c3ca8edc97a53189e3cb27b4118a5ca
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting Hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

Package: xul-ext-https-everywhere
Description-md5: 8288e29cbc6ae207bcc172bbf5cd3c97
Description-en: extension to force the use of HTTPS on many sites
 HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox/Iceweasel extension produced as a
 collaboration between The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier
 Foundation. It encrypts your communications with a number of major
 websites.
 .
 Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS,
 but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted
 HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted
 site.
 .
 The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all
 requests to these sites to HTTPS.

Package: xul-ext-https-finder
Description-md5: 78d5429497c567bd3b75540a789b60d9
Description-en: extension that detects valid HTTPS pages as you browse
 HTTPS Finder automatically detects and enforces valid HTTPS connections
 as you browse, as well as automating the rule creation process for
 HTTPS-Everywhere (instead of having to manually type "https://" in the
 address bar to test, and writing your own XML rule for it).
 .
 The extension sends a small HTTPS request to each HTTP page you browse
 to. If there is a response, the certificate is checked for validity (any
 certificate errors will result in no notification, and no further
 detection requests during that session). If valid, HTTPS is
 automatically enforced (can be disabled for an alert only, with no
 redirect), and the user is given an option to save the auto-generated
 rule for HTTPS Everywhere. It is recommended to create rules whenever
 possible, as it more securely enforces secure connections.

 Although primarily designed for use with the bitlbee IRC2IM gateway, it works
 within any query window, provided that the conversation partner's IRC client
 supports OTR.
 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      he sees are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.

Package: iwatch
Description-md5: 2c8b749aebb5341c753423d3588a86e8
Description-en: realtime filesystem monitoring program using inotify
 inotify (inode notify) is a Linux kernel subsystem that monitors
 events in filesystems and reports those events to applications in
 real time.
 .
 inotify can be used to monitor individual files or directories.
 When a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the
 directory itself and for files inside the directory.
 .
 iWatch is a Perl wrap to inotify to monitor changes in specific
 directories or files, sending alarm to the system administrator
 (or other destination) in real time. It can:
 .
   - Send notifications via email about changes.
   - Take programmable actions immediately, as emit alerts via
     XMPP (jabber) messages, WhatsApp or execute a local program
     or script.
   - Act as HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) or an
     integrity checker, complementing the firewall system in
     networks.
 .
 iWatch can run as a simple command, as well a daemon.
 .
 A good example of iWatch usage is to monitor the pages directory
 in webservers to notify, in real time, about defacements. Another
 example is to synchronize configuration files between machines,
 when they are changed, as in DHCP servers acting in failover mode.

 using the jupp package and implementation (both binaries and manpages).
 It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian's
 joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
 the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupps new
 features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.

Package: jupp
Description-md5: fc3d4f1020f64e3a9404f51ef044e72a
Description-en: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has eight help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimisation algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, block move, copy, delete or filter, a
 bracketed paste mode automatically enabled on xterm-xfree86 and decimal
 and hexadecimal gotos for lines, columns, and file offsets.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar, and a restricted mode version (lets you edit only the files
 specified on the command line).  Joe also has a deferred screen update to
 handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not bypassed by tty
 buffering.  It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work on any
 kind of sane terminal.  Furthermore, it supports SELinux context copying
 on Debian systems with the Linux kernel.
 .
 This version of JOE only comes with the Jupp flavour, to not conflict
 with the Debian joe package, activated. The resource files and executable
 links and menu entries for the other flavours are still available, though,
 in the joe-jupp package.

Package: kbuild
Description-md5: a6a88ec57452f04f777c23642a30d83d
Description-en: framework for writing simple makefiles for complex tasks
 The goals of the kBuild framework:
  - Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
  - Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing ad-hoc
    solutions.
  - Makefile can very simple to write and maintain.
 .
 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
  - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
  - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
    simplification.
  - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
  - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well
 use the full GNU package.

Description-md5: e2d2506352721e77c2c351de4714ddd6
Description-en: Failover and monitoring daemon for LVS clusters
 keepalived is used for monitoring real servers within a Linux
 Virtual Server (LVS) cluster.  keepalived can be configured to
 remove real servers from the cluster pool if it stops responding,
 as well as send a notification email to make the admin aware of
 the service failure.
 .
 In addition, keepalived implements an independent Virtual Router
 Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2; see rfc2338 for additional info)
 framework for director failover.

Package: keysync
Description-md5: d355bd07301cd7f78a0524b3bf733ec7
Description-en: Syncs OTR identities between the different chat programs
 There are many chat apps that support OTR encryption for verifying messages.
 Many use multiple chat apps, including one for desktop and another for
 mobile, or one for Mac OS X and another for GNU/Linux or Windows.  The trust
 relationships are only stored locally in the app in a format that is specific
 to that app.  Switching between all of them means that you have to manage
 your trust relationships for each app that you use.
 .
 KeySync addresses this problem by allowing you to sync your OTR identity and
 trust relationships between multiple apps.  It currently works with
 ChatSecure on Android, and Pidgin, Adium, and Jitsi on desktop.  This project
 is for converting the various OTR file formats between each other.
 Currently, KeySync is focused on the two major OTR implementations: libotr
 and otr4j, but it is modular enough to allow adding support for any OTR
 implementation.

Description-en: fast key-value storage library
 LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that
 provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
 .
 Features:
  * Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.
  * Data is stored sorted by key.
  * Callers can provide a custom comparison function to override
    the sort order.
  * The basic operations are Put(key,value), Get(key), Delete(key).
  * Multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch.
  * Users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of
    data.
  * Forward and backward iteration is supported over the data.
  * Data is automatically compressed using the Snappy compression
    library.
  * External activity (file system operations etc.) is relayed through
    a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system
    interactions.
  * Detailed documentation about how to use the library is included with
    the source code.
 .
 Limitations:
  * This is not a SQL database. It does not have a relational data model,
    it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.
  * Only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a
    particular database at a time.
  * There is no client-server support builtin to the library.
    An application that needs such support will have to wrap their own
    server around the library.

 The regular chown system call will dereference a symlink and apply ownership
 changes to the file at which it points. Some OSes provide system calls that
 do not dereference a symlink but instead apply their changes directly to the
 named path, even if that path is a symlink (in much the same way that lstat
 will return attributes of a symlink rather than the file at which it points).

 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when

 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing

Package: libserver-starter-perl
Description-md5: 4f73c904dc55de5ad3bf5674d8d2016d
Description-en: superdaemon for hot-deploying Perl server programs
 It is often a pain to write a server program that supports graceful restarts,
 with no resource leaks. Server::Starter solves the problem by splitting the
 task into two. One is start_server, a script provided as a part of the module,
 which works as a superdaemon that binds to zero or more TCP ports or unix
 sockets, and repeatedly spawns the server program that actually handles the
 necessary tasks (for example, responding to incoming commenctions). The spawned
 server programs under Server::Starter call accept(2) and handle the requests.
 .
 To gracefully restart the server program, send SIGHUP to the superdaemon. The
 superdaemon spawns a new server program, and if (and only if) it starts up
 successfully, sends SIGTERM to the old server program.

 Binding.  gdb will automatically use these symbols when debugging libxcb.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Package: lime-forensics-dkms
Description-md5: cb370b8d5216a7ee6a5025cd0a804f1f
Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: 15a3930c90f4a70018af692850997920
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.6.

Package: mac-robber
Description-md5: a6b5a6400c4d5a7fbaaaa60c532ae6fb
Description-en: collects data about allocated files in mounted filesystems
 mac-robber is a digital investigation tool (digital forensics) that collects
 metadata from allocated files in a mounted filesystem. This is useful during
 incident response when analyzing a live system or when analyzing a dead
 system in a lab. The data can be used by the mactime tool in The Sleuth Kit
 (TSK or SleuthKit only) to make a timeline of file activity. The mac-robber
 tool is based on the grave-robber tool from TCT (The Coroners Toolkit).
 .
 mac-robber requires that the filesystem be mounted by the operating system,
 unlike the tools in The Sleuth Kit that process the filesystem themselves.
 Therefore, mac-robber will not collect data from deleted files or files that
 have been hidden by rootkits. mac-robber will also modify the Access times
 on directories that are mounted with write permissions.
 .
 mac-robber is useful when dealing with a filesystem that is not supported
 by The Sleuth Kit or other filesystem analysis tools. You can run mac-robber
 on an obscure, suspect UNIX filesystem that has been mounted read-only on a
 trusted system.

Description-en: Metadata anonymisation toolkit
 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
 data that are being documented.
 .
 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
 .
 Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.
 .
 If you really want to be anonym, use format that does not contain any
 metadata, or better: use plain-text.
 .
 Formats supported to some extent are:
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    - JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)
    - Open Document (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)

Description-md5: 3d9ea3e08c317f931e9646ec11c73197
Description-en: UPnP IGD client lightweight library client
 The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft
 Windows 2K/XP. The aim of the MiniUPnP project is to bring a free software
 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular.
 .
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.
 .
 This package is an example client for the library.

Package: mksh
Description-md5: c93bd71d4c9825bcd412f33463650e94
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and may be used as /bin/sh
 on Debian systems (the /bin/lksh binary should be used for this), and
 as rescue and initrd shell (especially the /bin/mksh-static binary).
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc or
 dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and are usable)
 and optimised for small code size, for example for use on initrd or
 initramfs images, installation or rescue systems, or /bin/sh on slow
 architectures.
 It omits some leaf features to be even smaller.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.

Package: pdksh
Description-md5: a2a32660fef49ec89ed9052e6465fbd5
Description-en: transitional dummy package to migrate from pdksh to mksh
 The Public Domain Korn Shell "pdksh" is a mostly complete AT&T ksh
 look-alike, but has been superseded by mksh. This transitional dummy
 package exists to fulfil the needs of existing users, dependencies
 and build-dependencies by providing pdksh symlinks to the legacy
 flavour of mksh. You can safely remove it once you have no remaining
 users or scripts depending on pdksh any more (do make sure to check
 users' login shells).
 .
 Note: the mksh legacy flavour is not intended for interactive use.
 Please change your login shell to /bin/mksh and copy /etc/skel/.mkshrc
 to your home directory.

     can be rejected (or simply logged, if that is what you want). This feature
     can be used to prevent many types of attacks (e.g. XSS attacks, SQL
     injection, ...) and even allow you to run insecure applications on your
     servers (if you have no other choice, of course).

Description-en: repairs broken pcap and pcapng files
 libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level network
 monitoring. Network dumps based on libpcap can be made by tcpdump, wireshark
 and other tools. Sometimes those dumps can get corrupted by several reasons.
 Examples of this are a copy from Linux to Windows with a conversion to DOS/
 Windows text file line ending (CR-LF) or a transfer over FTP in ASCII mode
 instead of BINARY mode.
 .
 pcapfix tries to repair your broken pcap files, fixing the global header and
 recovering the packets by searching and guessing the packet headers.
 .
 pcapfix will first step through the packets top down until it recognizes a
 corrupted one by using plausibility checks. After that the tool will brute
 force further pcap packet headers by reading the file byte by byte. If another
 proper packet is found, pcapfix restores the data in between by adding a
 well-formed pcap packet header.
 .
 The PCAP Next Generation Dump File Format (or pcapng for short) is an attempt
 to overcome the limitations of the currently widely used (but limited) libpcap
 format. Since 1.0.0 version, pcapfix works with pcapng format too.

 Patchwork UTF-8 provides pure PHP implementations for mbstring, iconv, and
 intl. The following set of portability-fallbacks allows an application to run
 on a server even if those extensions are not enabled:
 .
  * utf8_encode, utf8_decode,
  * mbstring: mb_convert_encoding, mb_decode_mimeheader, mb_encode_mimeheader,
    mb_convert_case, mb_internal_encoding, mb_list_encodings, mb_strlen,

    grapheme_strlen, grapheme_strpos, grapheme_strripos, grapheme_strrpos,
    grapheme_strstr, grapheme_substr.
 .
 The Patchwork\Utf8 class implements the quasi-complete set of native string
 functions that need UTF-8 grapheme clusters awareness. Function names,
 arguments and behavior carefully replicates native PHP string functions.
 .
 Some more functions are also provided to help handling UTF-8 strings
 .
  * isUtf8(): checks if a string contains well formed UTF-8 data,

Package: php-psr-log
Description-md5: 61027d449ef97a57be423befc11f2312
Description-en: common interface for logging libraries
 The main goal is to allow libraries to receive a Psr\Log\LoggerInterface object
 and write logs to it in a simple and universal way. Frameworks and CMSs that
 have custom needs MAY extend the interface for their own purpose, but SHOULD
 remain compatible with this document. This ensures that the third-party
 libraries an application uses can write to the centralized application logs.
 .
 The LoggerInterface exposes eight methods to write logs to the eight RFC 5424
 levels (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency).
 .
 A ninth method, log, accepts a log level as first argument. Calling this method
 with one of the log level constants MUST have the same result as calling the
 level-specific method. Calling this method with a level not defined by this
 specification MUST throw a Psr\Log\InvalidArgumentException if the
 implementation does not know about the level. Users SHOULD NOT use a custom
 level without knowing for sure the current implementation supports it.
 .
 Note that this is not a logger of its own. It is merely an interface that
 describes a logger. See the specification for more details.

 testing framework, designed by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.  If you've used
 JUnit (for Java), PyUnit (for Python), CxxUnit (for C++), or any of the
 other equivalents for other languages, the API for this package should seem
 fairly familiar.  If you've never written unit tests before, the PHPUnit
 API is simple to learn and use.

Description-md5: 42e4885b6f6b4c8a5f1931f5a0a4a153
Description-en: Off-the-Record Messaging plugin for Pidgin
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      they see are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.
 .
 This is a Pidgin plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging.

 shared libraries with CMake.

Package: libdlrestrictions1
Description-md5: 28164c3828b6557ee21d394cbcb4648a
Description-en: library that implements library compatibility checks for dlopen()
 This package provides a DLRestrictions library that can be used to check
 compatibility of the external shared library (or plugin) against other
 libraries currently loaded in the global symbol object. It might help to avoid
 symbol clashes and provide means for graceful failure detection in advance
 before the first dlsym() call. Otherwise, usage of incompatible library might
 result in crashes or other unpredictable failures of the application.
 .
 A shared library that is protected by DLRestrictions provides a special symbol
 which defines conditions under which the library may be safely used. At the
 moment, the only restriction that may be imposed controls whether multiple
 SONAMEs of the same library can safely co-exist in the same symbol space.
 Shared library dependencies are also checked for compatibility.

  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.

Package: polipo
Description-md5: 68ad9c789b153cbad979231ce9a49525
Description-en: lightweight, caching web proxy
 Polipo is a caching web proxy (a web cache) designed to be used by one
 person or a small group of people. It is similar in spirit to WWWOFFLE, but
 the implementation techniques are more like the ones used by Squid.
 .
 Polipo has some features that are unique among currently available proxies:
 .
  o Polipo will use HTTP/1.1 pipelining if it believes that the remote
  server supports it, whether the incoming requests are pipelined or
  come in simultaneously on multiple connections (this is more than the
  simple usage of persistent connections, which is done by e.g. Squid);
 .
  o Polipo will cache the initial segment of an instance if the
  download has been interrupted, and, if necessary, complete it later
  using Range requests;
 .
  o Polipo will upgrade client requests to HTTP/1.1 even if they come
  in as HTTP/1.0, and up- or downgrade server replies to the client's
  capabilities (this may involve conversion to or from the HTTP/1.1
  chunked encoding);
 .
  o Polipo has fairly complete support for IPv6 (except for scoped
  (link-local) addresses).
 .
 Optionally, Polipo can use a technique known as Poor Man's Multiplexing
 to reduce latency.

 object-relational mapper, implemented on top of Python.
 .
 Its primary goal is to provide an object-oriented layer with the key
 aspects of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), i.e. polymorphism and
 message dispatch, without hindering the power of an RDBMS (Relational
 DataBase Management System).
 .
 Axiom is a live database, not only an SQL generation tool: it includes
 an implementation of a scheduler service, external file references,
 automatic upgrades, robust failure handling, and Twisted integration.
 .
 Axiom is tightly integrated with Twisted, and can store, start, and
 stop Twisted services directly from the database using the included
 'axiomatic' command-line tool.
 .
 Note: Axiom currently supports only SQLite and does NOT have any
 features for dealing with concurrency.

Description-en: B-tree library for Python
 An implementation of a particular kind of B-tree, based on research
 by Ohad Rodeh. This is the same data structure that btrfs uses, but
 in a new, pure-Python implementation.
 .
 The distinctive feature of this B-tree is that a node is never (conceptually)
 modified. Instead, all updates are done by copy-on-write. This makes it
 easy to clone a tree, and modify only the clone, while other processes
 access the original tree.
 .
 The implementation is generic and flexible, so that you may use it in
 a variety of situations. For example, the tree itself does not decide
 where its nodes are stored: you provide a class that does that for it.
 The library contains two implementations, one for in-memory and one
 for on-disk storage.

Description-md5: 058f67f385ccb0a52b2a8b0f73472732
Description-en: Python debug tracing helper
 Provides the Python library 'tracing' to help with logging debug messages.
 This library provides a function for logging debug messages.
 It is sometimes practical during software development to add a lot of
 debugging log messages to a program, but having them enabled all the time
 results in very large log files. Also, logging that much takes quite a
 bit of time.
 .
 This module provides a way to turn such debugging (or tracing) messages
 on and off, based on the filename they occur in. It is much faster than
 using `logging.Filter` to accomplish the same thing, which matters
 when code is run in production mode. The actual logging still happens
 using the `logging` library.

Package: python-tvrage
Description-md5: a0b8888fe1f5c58f7d6f8394868c140d
Description-en: Python client for the tvrage.com XML API
 python-tvrage is a Python-based object oriented client interface for
 tvrage.com's XML based api feeds.
 .
 The tvrage package consists of three modules
 .
  * the tvrage.feeds module provides a wrapper function for each of tvrage's
    XML-feeds
  * the tvrage.api module provides an clean and object oriented interface on top
    of those services
  * the tvrage.quickinfo module is a simple Pythonic wrapper for tvrage's
    quickinfo api. Values are returned as Python dictionaries rather than
    dedicated objects for tv shows and episodes
 .
 The tvrage.feeds module provides very basic and low level access to the
 tvrage.com data feeds. For more complex use cases it is recomended to use the
 object oriented module tvrage.api. Note: All functions in the tvrage.feeds
 module return XML data as ElementTree objects.

 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac

Description-en: library for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.

Description-en: graphical IRC client
 Smuxi is an irssi-inspired, flexible, user-friendly and cross-platform IRC
 client for sophisticated users, targeting the GNOME desktop.
 .
 Smuxi is based on the client-server model: The core application (engine) can
 be placed onto a server which is connected to the Internet around-the-clock;
 one or more frontends then connect to the core. This way, the connection to
 IRC can be kept up even when all frontends have been closed. The combination
 of screen and irssi served as example for this architecture.
 .
 Smuxi also supports the regular single application mode. This behaves like a
 typical IRC client; it doesn't need separate core management and utilizes a
 local engine that is used by the local frontend client.
 .
 This is a metapackage which depends on the default flavor of Smuxi, which is
 the GNOME frontend with Twitter and enhanced IRC support.

Package: syncmaildir
Description-md5: b351b723bcdb6875a853e251774b308b
Description-en: Sync Mail Dir is a set of tools to synchronize Maildirs
 Sync Mail Dir is a set of utilities to synchronize a pair of mail boxes
 in Maildir format, using SSH to transfer data. It provides the smd-pull
 utility to pull changes made on the remote mailbox, smd-push to propagate
 local changes to the remote mailbox, smd-loop to iterate push and pull
 in a timely way.
 .
 The software is young and should thus be used with care in production
 environments.
 .
 Unlike OfflineIMAP It requires no IMAP server to be installed on the remote
 host. Moreover it never attempts to automatically resolve conflicts between
 incompatible mailbox statuses, it just notifies the user explaining how
 he can fix the problem.
 .
 Sync Mail Dir design is similar to the one of Maildirsync, but is more
 efficient in terms of CPU cycles and disk I/O.

 Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
 multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
 own display, without special hardware.  It's intended for users
 with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
 own display.
 .
 Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse
 off the edge of your screen.  Synergy also merges the clipboards of
 all the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste between systems.
 Furthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so they all start and stop
 together and, if screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires
 a password to unlock them all.

Package: python-taurus
Description-md5: 97dc7730cc8c84851cd141eb1617f75f
Description-en: framework for Tango Control System CLI and GUI applications.
 TAURUS is a library for connecting client side applications (command-line
 interfaces and graphical user interfaces) to TANGO device servers, mainly
 developed by CELLS Alba Synchrotron Controls Section. TAURUS is built on top
 of PyTango which is a python binding for the Tango library. It provides an
 abstraction layer that allows TANGO to be accessed in a pythonic, object
 oriented way. For the GUI part, TAURUS is built on top of the graphical
 library PyQt which is a python binding for Qt.
 .
 The goals of this library are:
 Provide a simple Tango API to the end-user application
 Speed up development of tango based applications
 Provide a standardized look-and-feel
 .
 In many aspects, TAURUS follows the same approach as the TANGO Java
 Application Tool Kit: Tango ATK. If you know ATK, TAURUS will look familiar.
 .
 The TAURUS library is divided into two parts: the core module which handles
 all interaction with PyTango and the Qt module which provides a collection of
 widgets that can be used inside any PyQt based GUI.

Description-en: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandrake, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    .
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;
    - Cached Truecrypt passphrases;
    - Others.
 .
 Current version (2.4) supports investigations of the following memory images:
 .
    - 64-bit Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2;
