Package: clustalw-mpi
Description-md5: d0fe5d7d5d49a1a097a450ec20cd8cdc
Description-en: MPI-distributed global sequence alignment with ClustalW
 ClustalW is a popular tool for multiple sequence alignment. The
 alignment is achieved via three steps: pairwise alignment,
 guide-tree generation and progressive alignment. ClustalW-MPI is an
 MPI implementation of ClustalW. Based on
 version 1.82 of the original ClustalW, both the pairwise
 and progressive alignments are parallelized with MPI, a
 popular message passing programming standard. The
 pairwise alignments can be easily parallelized since the many
 alignments are time independent on each other. However
 the progressive alignments are essentially not parallelizable
 because of the time dependencies between each alignment.
 .
 Here the recursive parallelism paradigm is applied to the linear space
 profile-profile alignment algorithm. This approach is more time
 efficient on computers with distributed memory architecture.
 Traditional approach that relies on precomputing the profile-profile
 score matrix has also been implemented. Results shown the latter is indeed
 more appropriate for shared memory multiprocessor computer.
 .
 ClustalX is suggested for its support for local realignments, seaview
 is a versatile editor of alignments.
 .

Description-en: Multilingual software speech synthesizer
 Mbrola is Thierry Dutoit's phonemizer for multilingual speech synthesis. The
 various diphone databases are distributed on separate packages, but they
 must be used with and only with Mbrola because of license matters. Read the
 copyright for details.
 .
 Mbrola itself doesn't provide full TTS. It is a speech synthesizer based on
 the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input,
 together with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear
 description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear),
 at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.
 .
 Use Mbrola along with Freephone, cicero or espeak to have a complete
 text-to-speech in English.

 with a special focus on supporting the use of the Relaxed
 Complex Scheme. It includes web based access to applications
 such as NAMD, AutoDock, PDB2PQR, APBS, MGLToos and couples them
 in a flexible and scalable fashion through cloud computing.
 It is developed as a standalone application, using Vision
 (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MGLTools#Vision) as
 the backend engine for visual programming and workflow execution.
 The scientific applications are made accessible through CADD using
 Opal Web services (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=Opal)
 for scalable and distributed computation.
 .
 The workflow components of the CADD pipeline are currently released
 as Vision networks packaged for specific processes in a modular
 fashion. These modules may be coupled at ease for more complex
 processes. In the future, they may also be accessible from workflow
 repositories such as MyExperiment.org, and from AutoDockTools.  The Opal
 services used in the CADD workflow may be accessed using programmatic
 access, the Opal Server Dashboard or other workflow clients such as
 Kepler, VisTrails or Taverna through Opal plugins available at Opal
 Sourceforge website (http://opal.nbcr.net).

Description-en: NVIDIA binary kernel module DKMS source (71xx legacy version)
 This package builds the NVIDIA Xorg binary kernel module needed by
 nvidia-glx-legacy-71xx, using DKMS.
 Provided that you have the kernel header packages installed, the kernel
 module will be built for your running kernel and automatically rebuilt for
 any new kernel headers that are installed.
 The NVIDIA binary drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration of
 OpenGL applications via a direct-rendering X Server for graphics cards
 using NVIDIA chip sets.  AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out and flat panel displays
 are also supported.
 .
 WARNING: This driver only works with xserver 1.4 that was included in
 Debian 5.0 (lenny).  Newer xserver versions are not supported by NVIDIA.
 Use a free driver (nouveau or nv) instead or upgrade to nvidia-glx-legacy-96xx
 (if that still supports your GPU).
 .
 This legacy version is the last release that supports the following GPUs:
 RIVA TNT [NV4], RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro [NV5M64],
 RIVA TNT2/TNT2 Pro [NV5], RIVA TNT2 Ultra [NV5], Aladdin TNT2 [NV5],

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 79dff9cc36d9958abb1bf5894cc413a2
Description-en: A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation game.
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

 press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the
 Network News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server
 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing
 just local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you
 can configure trn to access it.

Description-en: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.
